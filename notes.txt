Hooks are functions provided by react to use those in your components



useState
- A hook that adds state to function components
- The argument to useState(0) is the initial state

useEffect
- Like side effects, renders everytime you re-render in your application
- Can be used to fetch api and change the dom
- Clean up 
- 2nd parameter will take a dependecy array 
- Empty array will render once after rendering to page
- To re-run useEffect on a update of the state we pass in the state
- Can also have a cleanup being returned to reduce memeory leaks



 useEffect(()=>{
// code for effects
return ()=>{
    // cleanup 
}

},[count])
